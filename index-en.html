                    <p class="historia">I've always loved everything that involves technology, when I got my first cell phone when I was 15 years old it didn't have that much technology, but I was drawn to how the layout was made and how the applications fit on the cell phone, then after starting to work I started to change for more sophisticated cell phones and that's when I was more delighted with games and applications, And it was no different when I bought my first computer that also caught my attention was the programs and its interface, And with that I started using this computer to root my cell phones and that of my colleagues and installing systems on them, And then I started to do the same with computers, installing systems and cracking programs and every day it woke me up more, The interest in learning more about technology and that's when I took a basic computer course but i thought it was too shallow and i did an advanced computer course i saw that i wanted more i also did a micro maintenance one, and i started to research more deeply that's when i started watching videos on YouTube about programming and trying to learn on my own, because my resources weren't enough to pay for a course, And also because at that time it was more difficult because I didn't see much talk about the subject, So what I found on YouTube I tried to learn, AND in some time I discovered some online schools that had some very cheap courses and others free, And through these courses I started to see that programming is for all people who decide to dedicate themselves to it, And 1 year ago I started at the faculty of analysis and systems development and taking other courses as well, And today I know that programming is for everyone, today I already structure a page and I know that there will always be something new to learn in programming, And if I have to study the rest of my life to have a good base in my area you can be sure I will do this.</p>
